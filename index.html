      The ability to monetize the results
      of design work done for any digital platform has
       been a difficult proposition.
       The rampant disregard for copyright,
       if not the outright theft of intellectual property,
       is leading to the decline in talent being willing
       to have works placed on any digital platform.
       when such placement is viewed as being the
       equivalent to removing any claims the artist
       has to work in question.
       This is leading to the listing of works
       of art on services such as Getty images and Adobe gallery.
       As these works are then placed in competition with free
       images available on the web, The professional artist/stylist
       will be replaced by whatever can be had.
